### First 30 seconds

You find yourself locked in a locked auditorium after falling asleep in a math class. 

The door is locked and there is no visible key. 

You can start walking around the room freely in search of a way to open the door.

There are many clues scattered throughout the room, once you found and resolved 
the clue you will get a hint of the next one that will bring you closer to the exit.
